# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is a program I had to write for a winter semester assignment to create a non linear classifier using python and numpy.

**The objectif was to segment 2D data using kernel method**.

I Implemented rbf, linear, polynomial and sigmoidal kernel using the equation provided in [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/r.html?C=1JDTYWBDK5ZYA&R=23JFUCXFL7PO9&T=C&U=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.ca%2FPattern-Recognition-Machine-Learning-Christopher%2Fdp%2F0387310738%2Fref%3Dcm_sw_em_r_dp_w_da_Z1azyb42CFTF5_tt&A=YPAQJN5AWLHNLWKXFJ8XELY0HGMA&H=GLWDX9FBUFF4AVUODIVRBSWRSS8A) by Christopher M. Bishop.

I coded these files: **map_noyau.py** and **non_lineaire_classification.py**

gestion_donnees.py, a skeleton of non_lineaire_classification.py and map_noyau.py was already given by the teacher.

# How to ðŸ§™

Step 1: Run

```bash
source ./setup.sh
```

Step 2: Run

```bash
python non_lineaire_classification.py rbf 100 200 0 0
```

**Manual**

```bash
python non_lineaire_classification.py -h
```
